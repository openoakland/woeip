Project Description
-------------------
WOEIP has collected Air Quality (AQ) data over several years. The original AQ database is no longer accessible to WOEIP, leaving them without access to collected data. As a result, they've suspended their citizen scientist data collection program. team within OpenOakland has partnered with WOEIP in order to build a replacement. The project, known as WOAQ, will allow WOEIP to intuitively store, process, and visualize their data. Ultimately, this will empower local residents to drive change in their community.
